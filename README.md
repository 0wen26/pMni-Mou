# 41 Test

This is a test suite for 42 assignments, providing automated tests for checking before submitting your assignments.

## Introduction

This is now day 11 of piscine. I have wasted so many hours getting evaluated, doing evaluation, waiting for evaluation, only to come back redoing it again because I kept making silly mistakes. I wish I can check my code thoroughly before submitting, but that too, will take a lot of my time. This is why I build this so I can stop wasting my time and many others, and shut moulinette up with just a single submission.

## Why 41?

42 is basically trademarked and I probably don't want to get sued.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

## Documentation

To run:

1. Put the `41test` directory in your assignment directory, where you store your ex00, ex01... directories.
2. Change directory to inside the `41test` directory.

```bash
cd 41test
```

3. Run the `test.sh` from inside.

```bash
./test.sh <Insert assignment number/>
```

E.g.:

```bash
./test.sh C02
```
