# 41 Test

This is a test suite for 42 assignments, providing automated tests for checking before submitting your assignments.

## Introduction

This is now day 11 of piscine. I have wasted so many hours getting evaluated, doing evaluation, waiting for evaluation, only to come back redoing it again because I kept making silly mistakes. I wish I can check my code thoroughly before submitting, but that too, will take a lot of my time. This is why I build this so I can stop wasting my time and many others, and shut moulinette up with just a single submission.

## Why 41?

42 is basically trademarked and I probably don't want to get sued.

## Disclaimer

41 Test doesn't check if there's extra files or norm, you need to do it manually. Pair it with `norminette` and `ls */*` , you are good to go!
